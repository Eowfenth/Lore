DRAFT 1.

Day no. 60
I had a dream last night.

Once, I was in a dark room. I could only see my hands moving and the shades of the curves in the end of a mouth.
I rose my body and let the room be enlighted by the only candle I had. The dark was dead and the silhouette of woman was lit as a renaissance masterpiece.
One thing happened: I looked over that image and kept looking almost an accident in the middle of a street, where you can't take your eyes off.
Except, there was nothing tragic at all in that scenery, everything seemed to perfect match. 
The reflection of the eyes. 
The smiling face.
The exceptional projection of her breasts in the wall. 
I could not tell if what was more intense: her glowing red hair or the effect the candle caused.
Could not tell what I wanted more: kept that sight for the my lasting memory or wanted her to bring every part of her presence to me.
I heard an almost unheard sound of 'click' and tried to tell myself that that memory was indeed saved, watched the differences of light and accepted my fate.
Then, I went almost instantly to her touch.
