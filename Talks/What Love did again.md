Version: 1

Upon entering the bar, I have noticed her sitting accompanied with two other women.
Both of them just does not seem from here, curiously they was too much alike. 
Indeed, they were not human. I don't know what they were, but I was sure I wasn't sharing the room with other human.
They doesn't seem to be under any veil nor glamour. They looked like booze pal of Oshun.

- OH, ANTHONY! Whaat I can do for you tonight?
- Hey, there, Oshun.
I know, I know, I am an insolent. But this is the way I handle fear. And I was afraid as hell to be in the same room with these whoever they were.
So I was subtle: 
- I am not comfortable with the presence of your companions.
Who are they? Of course, in respect of my own presence.
Okay, okay, I know I can be that annoying.

- Oh, boy, they are somewhat like me.
Although we have divergent views about one issue or another,
we represent the same virtue, yet for different people.
Although I cannot talk for them, this may be enough for you.
or should I be rude to my guests and go against their will?

Curiously enough, they don't seem to be from here. I mean here as here human, human here. They are not human at all.
Just after I end this sentence, the woman in the right leave a small smurk while the woman in the left seems absent.
In retrospect, I think I did not think about this throughtfully.
I could be facing not one but three deities here. Three deities of love.
- No need for that. I think we can talk.
- So we do. Let me begin, then. What I can do for you, Tony?
- I need to break a spell. A love's spell.
- Oh, and what you think I can help you with that?
- You know why.
- No, boy, actually you seems to don't know.
- What you mean?
In this moment, the woman in the right speak for the first time.
- She is wondering why you think SHE can help you with that.
- Love evolved.
Oshun said and I ask her:
- You didn't too?
She ignores it and continue saying:
- We represent something clear, defined. It has a shape, a weight, sometimes, yes, more can be added to this. Like a color or a feeling.
But what you are dealing with is not what we represent. 
Oshun says and continues:
- Actually, it is something we loathe for.
- This is curious, you seem to represent the same idea of a twisted love. What is different this time?
- The frailty of its nature.
The woman in the right says.
- It's subtle yet completely different.
Oshun complements it.
- One of my people...
The women in the right says:
- Defined it for you very recently. Love has changed. It is frail and transient. He called it Love Liquid.
- Hollow. 
The woman in the left completes, and I follow asking:
- You mean Bauman? Hell, you gods are quite updated among human sociology.
- Yes, he answered by that name. Zygmunt Bauman.
She said completely ignoring my sarcasm.
(Oh, she was slavic). Not only I have to handle Oshun, now I have a short temper goddess here too. I have pretended I was just using my cellphone while searched what was the goddess of love of slavic folks. Pam-pam-pam, and well, this godddess must be Lada, and indeed she represents the slavics. Okay, Oshun and Lada. Who is the third one?
- I see, do you are knowledgeable in liquid modernism too?
I asked pointing to the lady in the left.
There was a silent for 3 or 4 seconds, almost uncomfortable, then she said:
- We are what we are. I have no interest in these affairs. I cannot change what people want as I cannot care for something that is not under my control.
- Okay. Who are you? Oshun is here, and Lada too. There is must be a hell of love party tonight.
I was quite bothersome to some goddesses that outlived me for at least one thousand years, I admit it.
- I answer my people as Venus.
H-h-ooly. I was in the same room as the fucking Venus herself and I was being quite the jerk asking who the hell were they.
- A quite stoic behavior, it seems.
- It seems so.
Oh, God, I love her.
- Okay, what I can do then? Who is the love god in charge of this new kind of love?
- Dunno. I have principles. I may be a love goddess but I don't like new neighbors.
Oshun said.
Oh, God, I love her too.
