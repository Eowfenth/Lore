Revision: 3

Upon entering the bar, I have noticed her sitting accompanied with two other women.
Both of them just does not seem from here, curiously they was too much alike. 
Yet they don't seem human at all. I don't know what they were, but I was sure I wasn't sharing the room with other human.
They doesn't seem to be under any veil nor glamour. They looked like booze pal of Oshun.

_- OH, ANTHONY! Whaat I can do for you tonight?_

_- Hey, there, Oshun._

I know, I know, I am an insolent. But this is the way I handle fear. And I was afraid as hell to be in the same room with these whoever they were.
So I was subtle: 

_- I am not comfortable with the presence of your companions.
Who are they? Of course, in respect of my own presence._

Okay, okay, I know I can be that annoying.

_- Oh, boy, they are somewhat like me.
Although we have divergent views about one issue or another,
we represent the same virtue, yet for different people.
Although I cannot talk for them, this may be enough for you.
or should I be rude to my guests and go against their will?_

Curiously enough, they don't seem to be from here. I mean here as here human, human here. They are not human at all.
Just after I end this sentence, the woman in the right leave a small smurk while the woman in the left still absent.
In retrospect, I think I did not think about this throughtfully.

I could be facing not one but three deities here. Three deities of love.

_- No need for that. I think we can talk._

_- So we do. Let me begin, then. What I can do for you, Tony?_

_- I need to break a spell. A love's spell._

_- Oh, and what you think I can help you with that?_

_- You know why._

_- No, boy, actually you seems to don't know._

_- What you mean?_

In this moment, the woman in the right speak for the first time.

_- She is wondering why you think SHE can help you with that._

_- Love evolved._

Oshun said and I asked her:

_- You didn't too?_

She ignores it and continue saying:

_- We represent something clear, defined. It has a shape, a weight, sometimes, yes, more can be added to this. Like a color or a feeling.
But what you are dealing with is not what we represent._

Oshun says and continues:

_- Actually, it is something we loathe for._

_- This is curious, you seem to represent the same idea of a twisted love. What is different this time?_

_- The frailty of its nature._

The woman in the right says.

_- It's subtle yet completely different._

Oshun complements it.

_- One of my people..._

The women in the right says:

_- Defined it for you very recently. Love has changed. It is frail and transient. He called it Love Liquid._

_- Hollow._ 

The woman in the left completes, and I follow asking:

_- You mean Bauman? Hell, you gods are quite updated among human sociology._

_- Yes, he answered by that name. Zygmunt Bauman._

She said completely ignoring my sarcasm.
(Oh, she was slavic). Not only I have to handle Oshun, now I have a short temper goddess here too. I have pretended I was just using my cellphone while searched who was the goddess of love of slavic folks. Pam-pam-pam, and well, this godddess must be Lada, and indeed she represents the slavics. Okay, Oshun and Lada. Who is the third one?

_- I see, do you are knowledgeable in liquid modernism too?_

I asked pointing to the lady in the left.
There was a silent for 3 or 4 seconds, almost uncomfortable, then she said:

_- We are what we are. I have no interest in these affairs. I cannot change what people want as I cannot care for something that is not under my control._

_- Okay. Who are you? Oshun is here, and Lada too. There is must be a hell of love party tonight._

I was quite bothersome to some goddesses that outlived me for at least one thousand years, I admit it.

_- I answer my people as Venus._

H-h-ooly. I was in the same room as the fucking Venus herself and I was being quite the jerk asking who the hell were they.

_- A quite stoic behavior, it seems._

_- It seems so._

Oh, God, I love her.

_- Okay, what I can do then? Who is the love god in charge of this new kind of love?_

_- Dunno. I have principles. I may be a love goddess but I don't like new neighbors._

Oshun said.

Oh, God, I love her too.
