Despite the mines worked as assurances for the whole village, giving the revenue and resources
the Crown demanded, once the new beliefs were integrated, new demands were made: the children
who were younger than 8 years old must go to --

By the 7th spring, 32 children had left and never came back
Never more was heard anything about any of them.
The Church said they were devoting their lives for their unnamed God
It was a usual migration, most of parents were satisfied,
their own offspring fighting for God.

I thought something had to be done. The leader didn't agree, even with his daughter being an object
to the Church. So I acted, I've wrote a letter threating to report the Church to the Counsil of Andares
signed by the leader of the village.

And then, they reacted.

THe village was accused of heresy, was burned to the ground, while the women and girls were raped and the men slaughtered
by the King's orders shadowed by the Church.

All those people... Their blood... Those kids... Are in my hands.
The Leader's family was marked.
The village once known as Dribat was erased to the ashes.
I did run to the Dunes, at the moment I didn't feel anything.
Once I hid my self in the sand, I felt the Hell in the ground.
I stayed there for three nights.
No reason anymore to...
Despair... lack of air...
And her...
I have to find her....
Find her...
Have to make them stop...
First I need ---
[...] Knowledge. Information. Skills ...
I had to go back. See if I can find anything useful.
Reaching the left of the falling marked three boys and a woman.
Deep wounds in their bodies, most likely swords.
The woman though, there were not a piece where she resembled a woman. The amount of blod between what once was her legs.

While I buried them I noticed a container, somewhat small, where it was put  behind some wooden boxes.
It contained scrolls, twelve of them to be exact.
