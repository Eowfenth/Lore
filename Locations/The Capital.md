Usually, the life in the Capital is harsh.
The taxes -- the absence of calmness -- the constant htreat of violence -- the war -- and mainly the need of fire and food.
By the description, It is lear it isn't easy to handle. But despite this fact, people stay confident -- stay together as long as their king gives them hope.

People in the Capital are strong -- They have hope. They don't waste time. The worst villain always was the time, and it brought a misguided company, the winter.
They lost desire and lastlonging hope that united those.
