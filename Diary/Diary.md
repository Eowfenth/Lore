Consistency.

Fuck you, Goethe.
Fuck you, Zygmunt.

They say: Miss out or waste time.

Here lies your love.
Dead. Inapt. Broken.
Not sufficient for you.

It has been decided. Not by me.
I cannot decide. I am unsuitable to vote.
I am as broken as I seem to be.

I am so valuable as distant as you should be.
I am toxic, uncurable and hollow.

The balance comes, Nature says to me,
It goes, it comes.
No, Noha, you can't fight it.
You can't hide from it.
You embrace it.

You failed it.
It is time to move on.
