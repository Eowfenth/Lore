# At first, the climate and its dunes, vastiness, they looked like endless empires of sand, imposing and unbeatable. The soil shown its heat although we could handle with it
# it costed more supplies than we expected.
# We were amazed, we had a long trip, our systems counted 13 years and after that, any place was the place, it was our first mistake. 
# After 178 dawns(Yes, we've counted it) in this world, we thought we were alone, and this was the second mistake.
# They have noticed us and we failed to notice them. Filares was taken and we enslaved.
# Surprisingly, they have an effective way to enslave being, they give you a choice: be their slave or die freely.
# I would be lying if I told you all of them were atrocious. They had an history about being slaved, they had an history about being conquerers.
# And some of us comprehend its consequencies in different ways.
