###### The Wolfcry

```Nally's Wolfcry Tavern is one of accorded neutral grounds - these fields aren't point of 

interest of any party involved thus assassinations, plots aren't associated to them or 

anyone in particular. Outlaws, assassins and shades dwell near of Wolfcry. Some of 

them lives from rumors, tales, deals and in some desperate cases: telling the truth.

The origin of the Tavern is told be old as the Wolfcry itself. It is told the Wolfcry shared 

part of their land with Nally, they trusted Nally the dominance of the Red Earth and 

whether under his powers or not, some says The Lords decided to let it be a neutral 

ground for good, the spirits---the Protectors will not let any foreigner to own these fields. 

By the other hand, the origin of Nally is unknown, the only thing that remains truth is 

the fact whatever your language or your kin is, wherever you came from or why you 

came or are in these fields: it doesn't matter, in the Red lands, we all are equal and 

there is only one ruler: Nally.```



```The Wolfcry is located in the Red Lands. These lands once was home of the oldest kins 

and clans of wolves and dogs. You choose it: the known genre Canis itself, High Wolves, 

Templar Dogs and etc. The whereabout of most of them is unknown, some Shamans 

says They are everywhere, They still are in these lands.```
