###### The Wolfcry

```

Nally's Wolfcry Tavern is one of accorded neutral grounds - these fields aren't point of 

interest of any party involved thus assassinations, plots aren't associated to them or 

anyone in particular. Outlaws, assassins and shades dwell near of Wolfcry. Some of 

them lives from rumors, tales, deals and in some desperate cases: telling the truth.

The origin of the Tavern is told be old as the Wolfcry itself. It is told the Wolfcry shared 

part of their land with Nally, they trusted Nally the dominance of the Red Earth and 

whether under his powers or not, some says The Lords decided to let it be a neutral 

ground for good, the spirits-the Protectors will not let any foreigner to own these fields. 

By the other hand, the origin of Nally is unknown, the only thing that remains truth is 

the fact whatever your language or your kin is, wherever you came from or why you 

came or are in these fields: it doesn't matter, in the Red lands, we all are equal and 

there is only one ruler: Nally.

The Wolfcry is located in the Red Lands. These lands once was home of the oldest kins 

and clans of wolves and dogs. You name it: the known genre Canis itself, High Wolves, 

Templar Dogs, those famous curses of Werewolves and etc. The whereabout of most of 

them is unknown, some Shamans says They are everywhere, They still are in these 

lands. 

The reasons of Wolfcry being a neutral point go beyond the desire of power of the 

most conquerors of history. Suspicious, ahn? Why those unbeatable conquerors would 

avoid battles in these lands? These lands for millennia there is only one kin that ruled: 

the Wolf-kin.

More suspicious is a supposed human to heir the Red Lands. And even more 

suspicious is a human with no background known. No relatives, no apparent allies or 

enemies. A completely blank page in a sea of nothing. At this point, there is a deafening 

silence, a blinding darkness of this situation: Even with these facts, there aren't any 

being that does not respect Nally. This is the most shady fact of this place and I won't 

dare to move myself too much.

Among humans, a touch, a gaze and a word or even the silence may completely 

destroy any human intentions. You might find more about a person in a handshake 

than hours of chatting. A gaze might show your shapes, your edges in a way so clear 

and bright that I would not be surprised if someone sees only darkness after that.

There is a safety inside of Tavern, a kind of diplomatic immunity that Nally struggled to 

keep though you don't get any clue of it. There are few people that I am afraid, 

sometimes I fear most their intentions, their influence than their power. Well, though 

influence is power. A lot of things to think, lack of time to act. This is my life, welcome.

Once I spoke alone with Nally. It-it was some of those moments that I tried to not 

move too much if you understand me. There are moments in life that you feel like a 

prey, a defenseless and delicious prey. Somehow I understand why the old Wolves 

transfered Its lands to him. He is definitely a wolf. One of the Great.

###### Nally's Profile and Talklines

Nally is a medium height man about 1,80 or 1,82cm, with brown eyes that looks like a darkered honey. He is a man in a good shape even with his gray hair and old pair of hands. He seems steady but tired, a fact of surviving enough time to live throught the worst times and luck to see some of the best. His movements are accurate, and probably he is stronger than the most of the men of the same age. Occur to me after long travels to the Wolfcry that he is a man of fews words.
