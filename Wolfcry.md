###### The Wolfcry

```
Nally's Wolfcry Tavern and Wolfcry territory itself are some of accorded neutral grounds -- these fields aren't point of interest of any party involved thus assassinations, plots aren't associated to them or anyone in particular. Outlaws, assassins and shades dwell near of Wolfcry. Some of them lives from rumors, tales, deals and in some desperate cases: telling the truth.

The origin of the Tavern is told be old as the Wolfcry itself. It is told the original clan shared part of their land with Nally, they trusted Nally the dominance of the Red Earth and whether under his powers or not, some says The Lords of the other provincies decided to let it be a neutral ground because it is not a strategical area, however I think they let it for good, the spirits-the Protectors will not let any foreigner to own these fields. 

By the other hand, the origin of Nally is unknown, the only thing that remains truth is the fact whatever your language or your kin is, wherever you came from or why you came or are in these fields: it doesn't matter, in the Red lands, we all are equal and we don't mess with him.

The Wolfcry is located to the north-west of the western continent. These lands once was home of the oldest kins and clans of wolves and dogs. You name it: the known genre Canis itself, High Wolves, Templar Dogs, those famous curses of Werewolves came from there and etc. The whereabout of most of them is unknown, some Shamans says 'They are everywhere, They still are in these lands.'

The reasons of Wolfcry being a neutral point go beyond the desire of power of the most conquerors of history. Suspicious I would say, ahn? Why those unbeatable conquerors would avoid battles in these lands? These lands for millennia there is only one kin that ruled: the Wolf-kin.

More suspicious is a supposed human to heir the Red Lands. And even more suspicious is a human with no background known. No relatives, no apparent allies or enemies. A completely blank page in a sea of nothing. At this point, there is a deafening silence, a blinding darkness of this situation: Even with these facts, there aren't any being that does not respect Nally. This is the most shady fact of this place and I won't dare to move myself too much.

Among humans, a touch, a gaze and a word or even the silence may completely destroy any human intentions. You might find more about a person in a handshake than hours of chatting. A gaze might show your shapes, your edges in a way so clear and bright that I would not be surprised if someone sees only darkness after that.

There is a safety inside of Tavern, a kind of diplomatic immunity that Nally struggled to keep though you don't get any clue of it. There are few people that I am afraid, sometimes I fear most their intentions, their influence than their power. Well, though influence is power. A lot of things to think, lack of time to act. This is my life, welcome.

Once I spoke alone with Nally. It-it was some of those moments that I tried to not move too much if you understand me. There are moments in life that you feel like a prey, a defenseless and delicious prey. Somehow I understand why the old Wolves transfered Its lands to him. He is definitely a wolf. One of the Great.

Despite of Red Lands mostly be around mountains and desert, you somehow feel that sensation of being watched, you can smells in that mix of scents flowers, plants, wood. Under the moon, you know their presence. You don't see them, but for sure they see you. You can hear them, but the most important they can hear you.

To the south- east, 

To the south-west,

###### Nally's Profile and Talklines

````
Nally is a medium height man about 1,80 or 1,82cm, with brown eyes that looks like a darkered honey. He is a man in a good shape even with his gray hair and old pair of hands. He seems steady but tired, a fact of surviving enough time to live throught the worst times and luck to see some of the best. His movements are accurate, and probably he is stronger than the most of the men of the same age. Occur to me after long travels to the Wolfcry that he is a man of fews words.
