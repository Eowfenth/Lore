I enunciate my thesis that she was a unfinished character.
Perhaps this initial debut is more about her author than her itself.
The author must have think of her as someone who should fail.
Something that should not be happy in their first have of their creation.
Some would argue that he/she who wrote her must thought her backstory as something to be evil. A villain, maybe?

Someone who break rules. 

Someone who doesn't feel guilty in do some imoral deeds. 

Someone who didn't feel worth of itself. 

Someone who hid your own smiles. 

Someone who had unrequited love as first love. 

Someone whose mother showed as much dislike as she could. 
I disagree with this notion.
Should be the author or the Life itself bear the blame for this? None at all, in my opinion.

The author simply did not take it for granted and made her existence remarkable unique. Gave her (mark my words, I am sure this is final) the most beautiful smile I've seen.
