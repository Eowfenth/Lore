I enunciate my thesis that she was more like an unfinished character.

Perhaps this initial debut is more about her author than her itself.

The author must have think of her as someone who should fail, one who should suffer and define the suffering by her own definition.

Something made with angry and sorrow. Something that doesn't match happy and care in their first thought of creation.

Some would argue that he/she who wrote her must thought her backstory as something intended to be evil. A villain, maybe? Something to be until the very end, broken.

Something that should not find the needed love. Something that should not deserve the needed love.

Someone who break rules. 

Someone who doesn't feel guilty in acting somehow imorally.

Someone who didn't feel worth of itself. 

Someone who hid your own smiles. 

Someone who will be regarded as disingenuous.

Someone who had unrequited love as first love. 

Someone whose mother showed as much dislike as she could. 

I disagree with this notion with a deep enjoyment.

Should be the author or the Life itself bear the blame for this? None at all.

Although I aspire to know why these things happened, to know excessively what they have produced.

What interest me the most are the promising of desired yet not the unspoken words.

[...] And then, the author chose the most audacious path to her story: gave her the due agency she demanded, to deny whatever she wanted and accept what she deserved.

The author did not take it for granted and made her existence remarkable unique. Made her (mark my words, I am sure this is final) with the most beautiful smile I've seen. [...]

Thus, she was reborn. As blank pages and a brand new black tin pen, we knew she was ready to write her own story.
